\usage{
regDIF(item.data,
       pred.data,
       item.type = NULL,
       pen.type = NULL,
       tau = NULL,
       num.tau = 100,
       alpha = 1,
       gamma = 3,

}
\arguments{
\item{item.data}{Matrix or data frame of item responses. See below for
supported item types.}

\item{pred.data}{Matrix or data frame of predictors affecting item responses
(DIF) and latent variable (impact). See \code{control} option below to
specify different predictors for impact model.}

\item{item.type}{Optional character value or vector indicating the type of
item to be modeled. The default is NULL, corresponding to a 2PL or graded
item type. Different item types may be specified for a single model
by providing a vector equal in length to the number of items in item.data.
The options include:
\itemize{
   \item{\code{"Rasch"} - Slopes constrained to 1 and intercepts freely
   estimated.}
   \item{\code{"2PL"} - Slopes and intercepts freely estimated.}
   \item{\code{"Graded"} - Slopes, intercepts, and thresholds freely
   estimated.}}}

\item{pen.type}{Optional character value indicating the penalty
function to use. The default is NULL, corresponding to the LASSO function.
The options include:
\itemize{
   \item{\code{"lasso"} - The least absolute selection and shrinkage
   operator (LASSO), which controls DIF selection through \eqn{\tau} (tau).}
   \item{\code{"mcp"} - The minimax concave penalty (MCP), which controls
   DIF selection through \eqn{\tau} (tau) and estimator bias through
   \eqn{\gamma} (gamma). Uses the firm-thresholding penalty function.}}}

\item{tau}{Optional numeric vector of tau values \eqn{\ge} 0. If tau is
supplied, this overrides the automatic construction of tau values.
Must be non-negative and in descending order, from largest
to smallest values (e.g., \code{seq(1,0,-.01)}.}

\item{num.tau}{Numeric value indicating how many tau values to fit. The
default is 100.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value indicating the alpha parameter in the elastic net
penalty function. Alpha controls the degree to which LASSO or ridge is used
during regularization. The default is 1, which is equivalent to LASSO.
NOTE: If using MCP penalty, alpha may not be exactly 0.}

\item{gamma}{Numeric value indicating the gamma parameter in the MCP
function. Gamma controls the degree of tapering of DIF effects as tau
decreases. Larger gamma leads to faster tapering (less bias but possibly
more unstable optimization), whereas smaller gamma leads to slower tapering
(more bias but more stable optimization). Default is 3. Must be greater
than 1.}

\item{anchor}{Optional numeric value or vector indicating which item
response(s) are anchors (e.g., \code{anchor = 1}). Default is \code{NULL},
meaning at least one DIF effect per covariate will be fixed to zero as
tau approaches 0 (required to identify the model).}

\item{stdz}{Logical value indicating whether to standardize DIF and
impact predictors for regularization. Default is \code{TRUE}, as it is
recommended that all predictors be on the same scale.}

\item{control}{Optional list of different model specifications and
optimization parameters. May be:
\describe{
   \item{impact.mean.data}{Matrix or data frame of predictors, which allows
   for a different set of predictors to affect the mean impact equation
   compared to the item response DIF equations. Default includes all
   predictors from pred.data.}
   \item{impact.var.data}{Matrix or data frame with predictors for
   variance impact. See above. Default includes all predictors in pred.data.}
   \item{tol}{Convergence threshold of EM algorithm. Default is
   \code{10^-5}.}
   \item{maxiter}{Maximum number of EM iterations. Default is \code{5000}.}
   \item{adapt.quad}{Logical value indicating whether to use adaptive
   quadrature to approximate the latent variable. The default is
   \code{FALSE}. NOTE: Adaptive quadrature is not supported yet.}
   \item{num.quad}{Numeric value indicating the number of quadrature
   points to be used. For fixed-point quadrature, the default is \code{21}
   points when all item responses are binary or else \code{51} points if at
   least one item is ordered categorical.}
   \item{optim.method}{Character value indicating which optimization method
   to use. Default is "multi", which updates the impact and item parameter
   estimates using multivariate Newton-Raphson. Another option is "uni",
   which updates estimates one-at-a-time using univariate Newton-Raphson, or
   a single iteration of coordinate descent. "Multi" will be faster in most
   cases, although "uni" may achieve faster results when the number of
   predictors is large.}
