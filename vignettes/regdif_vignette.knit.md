This vignette introduces `regDIF()` to the general user by providing common use cases.

## Using LASSO regularization to evaluate measurement bias in a 2-parameter logistic IRT model.

In this example, data in `ida` were generated to mimic an integrative data analysis, where
data are pooled across multiple studies and the measurement model is evaluated for between-study and
within-study (e.g., gender, age) measurement bias. These data include 6 item responses (binary)
and 3 background characteristics -- namely, age (continuous, centered), gender (categorical, 
effect-coded), and study (categorical, effect-coded).


```
##   item1 item2 item3 item4 item5 item6 age gender study
## 1     0     0     0     0     0     0  -2     -1    -1
## 2     0     0     0     0     0     0   0     -1    -1
## 3     0     0     0     0     0     0   3     -1    -1
## 4     0     1     1     1     1     1   1     -1    -1
## 5     0     0     0     0     0     0  -2     -1    -1
## 6     1     0     0     0     0     0   1     -1    -1
```
The item response data must first be separated from the predictor data (background variables) before
running `regDIF()`. A single value of the tuning parameter, `tau = 2`, is then fit to the data.

The `summary()` function shows that no DIF effects remain in the model. Only the latent variable
parameters and base item parameters, which were not penalized at all, are estimated to be non-zero.

Now that the data have been properly specified in `regDIF`, a more thorough investigation of DIF is
warranted. The `regDIF()` function defaults to estimating 100 values of the tuning parameter,
starting with a value large enough to penalize all DIF effects to zero. However, for brevity, only
10 values of tau are specified with the `num.tau` argument.

By printing the model object, 10 rows of results appear, one for each value of the tuning parameter.
The first thing to notice is that 4 rows are missing. This occurs because `regDIF()` automatically 
stops model-fitting when a small value of tau would produce a non-identified model. In focusing
attention to the BIC column, it is evident that the smallest value occurs well before the model
would be non-identified. This is an encouraging result. The `summary()` function may be used again,
which, with multiple values of the tuning parameter fit to the data, produces non-zero DIF effects 
corresponding to the model with the minimum value of BIC.
