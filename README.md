# regDIF: Regularized Differential Item Functioning

An R package that performs regularization of differential item functioning (DIF) in item response theory (IRT) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models using a penalized expectation-maximization algorithm.
 
## Features

* Handles multiple continuous and categorical DIF covariates. 
* Supports Bernoulli, categorical, and Gaussian item response distributions. 
* Includes LASSO, ridge, MCP, and elastic net penalty functions for regularization.

## Examples

Examples may be found here: (link available soon).
